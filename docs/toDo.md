# WasaPhoto operations

This is a cheap TODO list of the operations to be implemented for the WASAPhoto project, so that I don't have to check the PDF over and over again.

### Finishing the Operation
The API is considered to be "finished" (and will therefore be moved to v0.1.0)
when:

- [ ] All necessary Operations are implemented
- [ ] Paths and resources are implemented with a sensible philosophy that properly segments/nests individual concepts
- [ ] Individual operations and structures are properly detailed and constrained

Operations to be implemented:
- [x] doLogin (see simplified login)
- [x] setMyUserName
- [x] uploadPhoto
- [x] followUser
- [x] unfollowUser
- [x] banUser
- [x] unbanUser
- [x] getUserProfile
- [ ] getMyStream
- [ ] likePhoto
- [ ] unlikePhoto
- [ ] commentPhoto
- [ ] uncommentPhoto
- [x] deletePhoto
